# Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science-Specialization

About this Specialization
Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science is a foundational online program created by DeepLearning.AI and taught by Luis Serrano. This beginner-friendly Specialization is where you’ll master the fundamental mathematics toolkit of machine learning.

Many machine learning engineers and data scientists need help with mathematics, and even experienced practitioners can feel held back by a lack of math skills. This Specialization uses innovative pedagogy in mathematics to help you learn quickly and intuitively, with courses that use easy-to-follow plugins and visualizations to help you see how the math behind machine learning actually works. 

This is a beginner-friendly program, with a recommended background of at least high school mathematics. We also recommend a basic familiarity with Python, as labs use Python to demonstrate learning objectives in the environment where they’re most applicable to machine learning and data science.
