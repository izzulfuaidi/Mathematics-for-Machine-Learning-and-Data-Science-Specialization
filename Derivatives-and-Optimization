]
[0,7], how many zeros has its derivative

Correct
Correct! Since 
�
f has 
3
3 local minima and 
2
2 local maxima in the desired interval, it must have 
5
5 zeros. You can review the lecture 
Introduction to Optimization
 to get more details.

x 
max
​
  is a point where

​
 ) is a local maximum, then 
�
(
�
�
�

)
g(x

​
 ) is also a local maximum. 


Correct
Correct! When applying the function 
�
�
�
log to 
�
f, even though we change its shape, the maximum points will remain the same, since 
log
⁡
log is a crescent function!

�
�
x 
max
​
  is a point where 
�
(

)
f(x 
max
​
 ) is a local maximum, then

)
g(x 
max
​
 ) is also a local minimum.



If 
�
(

)
f(x) is differentiable, then so is 
�
(

)
g(x). 


Correct
Correct! The result of composing two differentiable functions is differentiable, by the chain rule.
